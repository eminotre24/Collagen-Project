# Collagen Project
This is a compilation of Notes and Codes made through the course of the research project: Modelling Wet Collagen Fibrils, developed through the course of the MITACS Research Internship.

The content is divided accordingly to the subject of the matter, as the following:
 - **Notes on LCE Theroy and Hydration Model:** Some notes and notebooks which serve as complementary for the understanding of the LCE model, which was the original model to follow through
 - **GROMACS Scripts & Files:** Upon taking the MD approach, we started using the GROMACS software for the simulations, at first trying to replicate the process followed by Liu et al. ([DOI](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijbiomac.2025.144728))
 - **Analysis of Results (MDAnalysis):** After getting the first results, started to use the module *MDAnalysis* available on Python, for analyzing output files of GROMACS.
