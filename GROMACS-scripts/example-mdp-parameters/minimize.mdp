; minim.mdp - used as input into grompp to generate em.tpr
; Its a modified version of the paper, to see how well this performs compared to the other
; Parameters describing what to do, when to stop and what to save
integrator  = steep         ; Algorithm conjugate gradient, we will add steep once in a while    
emtol       = 250.0        ; Stop minimization
emstep      = 0.01          ; Minimization step size
nsteps      = 50000         ; Maximum number of (minimization) steps to perform

; Parameters describing how to find the neighbors of each atom and how to calculate the interactions
nstlist         = 1         ; Frequency to update the neighbor list and long range forces
cutoff-scheme   = Verlet    ; Buffered neighbor searching
ns_type         = grid      ; Method to determine neighbor list (simple, grid)
coulombtype     = PME       ; Particle Mesh Ewald
rcoulomb        = 1.2       ; Short-range electrostatic cut-off
rvdw            = 1.2       ; Short-range Van der Waals cut-off
pbc             = xyz       ; Periodic Boundary Conditions in all 3 dimensions
